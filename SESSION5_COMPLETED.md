# Session 5: Relay Configuration - COMPLETED

## 🎯 Goal: Enable relay servers to enforce crypto policies
**Entry Criteria:** ✅ Session 4 complete, clients can request crypto modes  
**Exit Criteria:** ✅ Relay can enforce minimum security levels

## 📦 Deliverables Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Relay CLI Configuration

#### Crypto Policy Flags
```bash
# Relay configuration options for crypto policy enforcement
--require-post-quantum          # Require quantum-resistant cryptography
--minimum-crypto-mode <MODE>     # Set minimum acceptable crypto mode
--reject-classical               # Explicitly reject classical-only messages
--adaptive-recommendations       # Enable adaptive mode suggestions
--log-crypto-policy             # Log all policy decisions for compliance
```

#### Example Relay Configurations
```bash
# Permissive relay (accepts all crypto modes)
cargo run --bin relay -- --port 7733 --minimum-crypto-mode classical

# Security-focused relay (requires quantum resistance)
cargo run --bin relay -- --port 7734 --require-post-quantum --minimum-crypto-mode hybrid --adaptive-recommendations

# High-security relay (quantum only)
cargo run --bin relay -- --port 7735 --require-post-quantum --minimum-crypto-mode quantum --reject-classical
```

### 2. CryptoPolicyConfig System

#### Policy Configuration Structure
```rust
pub struct CryptoPolicyConfig {
    pub require_post_quantum: bool,
    pub minimum_crypto_mode: CryptoMode,
    pub adaptive_recommendations: bool,
    pub reject_classical: bool,
    pub log_policy_decisions: bool,
}
```

#### Policy Validation Logic
- **Post-quantum requirement checking**: Rejects non-quantum-resistant modes when enabled
- **Minimum mode enforcement**: Ensures messages meet minimum security requirements
- **Classical rejection**: Explicitly blocks classical cryptography when configured
- **Policy violation logging**: Detailed reasons for rejected messages

### 3. Policy Enforcement Engine

#### Message Validation Process
1. **Crypto mode identification**: Extract mode from message envelope
2. **Policy compliance check**: Validate against configured requirements
3. **Violation logging**: Record policy decisions with detailed reasons
4. **Statistics tracking**: Monitor acceptance/rejection rates
5. **Adaptive recommendations**: Suggest optimal modes based on conditions

#### Policy Decision Matrix
```
Relay Policy     | Classical | Hybrid | Quantum | Result
-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|--------
Permissive       |     ✅    |   ✅   |    ✅   | Accept
Require PQ       |     ❌    |   ✅   |    ✅   | Hybrid/Quantum only
Reject Classical |     ❌    |   ✅   |    ✅   | No classical
Quantum Only     |     ❌    |   ❌   |    ✅   | Quantum only
```

### 4. Enhanced Message Storage System

#### Mixed Message Support
```rust
enum StoredMessage {
    Legacy(MessageEnvelope),
    QuantumSafe(QuantumSafeEnvelope),
}
```

#### Storage Features
- **Dual format support**: Stores both legacy and quantum-safe messages
- **Automatic conversion**: Converts between formats as needed
- **Policy-aware storage**: Only stores messages that pass policy validation
- **Efficient cleanup**: Removes expired messages with minimal overhead

### 5. Policy Statistics and Monitoring

#### Real-time Statistics Tracking
```rust
pub struct PolicyStats {
    pub total_messages: u64,
    pub accepted_messages: u64,
    pub rejected_messages: u64,
    pub classical_messages: u64,
    pub hybrid_messages: u64,
    pub quantum_messages: u64,
    pub policy_violations: u64,
}
```

#### Monitoring Features
- **Real-time stats**: Updates every 5 minutes during operation
- **Compliance reporting**: Detailed acceptance/rejection metrics
- **Mode distribution**: Tracks usage patterns across crypto modes
- **Graceful shutdown stats**: Final report on relay termination

### 6. Enhanced Network Protocol Support

#### New RelayClient Methods
```rust
// Quantum-safe message sending
pub async fn send_quantum_envelope(&self, envelope: QuantumSafeEnvelope) -> Result<()>

// Quantum-safe message fetching
pub async fn fetch_quantum_inbox(&self, inbox_id: String) -> Result<Vec<QuantumSafeEnvelope>>

// Unified public key lookup
pub async fn lookup_username_unified(&self, username: String) -> Result<Option<UnifiedPublicKeys>>
```

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy support**: Maintains support for existing MessageEnvelope format
- **Automatic conversion**: Seamlessly converts between legacy and quantum-safe formats
- **Graceful fallback**: Handles mixed client environments

## ✅ Success Test Results

### 1. Policy Enforcement Validation ✓
```bash
🔍 Testing Policy Enforcement Logic:
   Test 1: Classical message to quantum-only relay
     ✅ PASS: Classical message properly rejected
   Test 2: Quantum message to permissive relay
     ✅ PASS: Quantum message accepted
```

### 2. Crypto Mode Compatibility ✓
```bash
🏢 Testing Security-Focused Relay (minimum mode: hybrid)
  📨 Testing Classical Message
     🚫 Message rejected by relay policy
  📨 Testing Hybrid Message
     ✅ Message accepted by relay policy
  📨 Testing Quantum Message
     ✅ Message accepted by relay policy
```

### 3. Policy Logging and Compliance ✓
```bash
🛡️  Crypto Policy Configuration:
   Require post-quantum: true
   Minimum crypto mode: hybrid
   Reject classical: true
   Adaptive recommendations: true
   Policy logging: true
   
🚫 Policy violation: classical message rejected - Post-quantum cryptography required
✅ Policy accepted: hybrid message stored (Strong against both classical and quantum attacks)
💡 Adaptive recommendation: Consider using quantum for optimal performance
```

### 4. Statistics Monitoring ✓
```bash
📊 Policy Stats: 15 total, 12 accepted, 3 rejected, 3 violations
📊 Final Policy Statistics:
   Total messages: 15
   Accepted: 12 (80.0%)
   Rejected: 3 (20.0%)
