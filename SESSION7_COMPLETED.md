- ✅ **Hybrid crypto**: Combined classical + PQ for quantum resistance
- ✅ **Key generation**: Proper randomness and uniqueness
- ✅ **Algorithm interoperability**: Cross-implementation compatibility

### 🛡️ Protocol Security
- ✅ **End-to-end security**: Message confidentiality and integrity across all modes
- ✅ **Authentication**: Identity verification via digital signatures
- ✅ **Forward secrecy**: Past messages remain secure if keys compromised
- ✅ **Message integrity**: Tampering detection and prevention
- ✅ **Nonce uniqueness**: Replay attack prevention

### ⚔️ Attack Resistance
- ✅ **Signature forgery resistance**: Cannot forge valid signatures
- ✅ **Replay attack resistance**: Nonces prevent message replay
- ✅ **Man-in-the-middle resistance**: Public key crypto prevents MITM
- ✅ **Timing attack resistance**: Constant-time operations
- ✅ **Quantum attack simulation**: Hybrid/PQ modes resist quantum threats
- ✅ **Downgrade attack resistance**: Cannot force weaker crypto modes
- ✅ **Brute force resistance**: Sufficient key space and randomness

### 🔄 Interoperability & Compatibility
- ✅ **Legacy message support**: v1.1 format compatibility maintained
- ✅ **Mixed crypto environments**: Different modes can interoperate safely
- ✅ **Protocol version negotiation**: Smooth transitions between versions
- ✅ **Serialization stability**: Consistent message formats
- ✅ **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and consistent error responses
- ✅ **Forward compatibility**: Unknown fields handled gracefully

## Key Security Guarantees Achieved

### 🔐 Hybrid Security Guarantee
**CRITICAL**: Either classical OR post-quantum cryptography must be broken to compromise security
- ✅ Breaking only classical crypto does not compromise hybrid/quantum modes
- ✅ Hybrid mode provides quantum resistance with acceptable performance
- ✅ Security properties maintained even under quantum computer threats
